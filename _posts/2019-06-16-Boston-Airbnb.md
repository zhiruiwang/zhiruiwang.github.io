As a Bostonian for almost 2 years, I have lived in Boston at several places. While wandering around different neighborhoods of this fabulous city, I am always wondering, **what would it be like to live in this neighborhood?** 

And as summer is coming, which is the best season of the city, I have noticed that the traffic has become heavier than usual when I get to work, and even is heavier than the same time last year. This also makes me wondering, **how busy is the summer time in Boston?** **By how much do hotel or AirBNB prices spike during this season?** And **is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Boston?**

With these questions in mind, I found the [Boston AirBNB Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) on Kaggle. Let's explore the data and find out the answer to my questions!
